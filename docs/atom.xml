<p>I said there is few problems in my Kubernetes when I upgraded it a week ago, here is the that post's link <a href="/2_how_to_upgrade_k8s.html">How to upgrade Kubernetes cluster</a>, one of problem is the Completed status of CronJob's pods can't auto clean even I set up <code>successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3</code> for it.</p>
<p>I knew that error is on the Etcd not Kubernetes after upgraded in a couple days,  So I want to upgrading the Etcd. There is a shell script file in my VM for a long time. It's wirtten for my build the Kubernetes one year ago</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="shell"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="bash">!/bin/sh</span>
mkdir -p /var/etcd
docker rm etcd1 -f
rm -rf /var/etcd
docker run --restart=always --net host -it --name etcd1 -d \
-v /var/etcd:/var/etcd \
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime \
k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10 \
etcd --name etcd-s1 \
--auto-compaction-retention=1 --max-request-bytes=33554432 --quota-backend-bytes=8589934592 \
--data-dir=/var/etcd/etcd-data \
--listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 \
--listen-peer-urls http://0.0.0.0:2380 \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls http://node4.cluster.local:2380 \
--advertise-client-urls http://node4.cluster.local:2379,http://node4.cluster.local:2380 \

-initial-cluster "etcd-s1=http://node4.cluster.local:2380,etcd-s2=http://node5.cluster.local:2380,etcd-s3=http://node6.cluster.local:2380" \
-initial-cluster-state new
</code></pre>
<p>I'm just change the <code>k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10</code> to <code>k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.15-0</code> and running it at once. Oh, I sure I was so stupid at that momment. I have no note that <code>rm -rf /var/etcd</code> and some initial arguments for etcd in last like <code>-initial-cluster-state new</code>.</p>
<p>There is ruinous for my Kubernetes cluster, All the service„ÄÅpod were losed. I can't do anything when I catch it, because I dit not backup the data of etcd before upgrade. So I got it there is a only way for me: rebuild a Kubernetes cluster and recover all of deploy, service, ingress!</p>
<p>It's a overtime work for me, I must be to do it as soon as posible when all the emails starting comes to me after the Kubernetes not working an hour. It took me a long time, I'm thinking about it</p>
<ul>
<li>Why not choice the internal Etcd cluster for Kubernetes? the most time it will be more relable than external.</li>
<li>Why am I upgrading in no back up data?</li>
<li>Why I did no read the shell scripts in detial when I running it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, it's my mistake, never do it again I told myself, I don't want to keep stupid all my life.</p>

<p>You don't need to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster in most time, there is no reason to upgrading if they running in stable, sometime we need to upgrade it for some bugs fixed and features. If you already have a running cluster and you want to upgrade it, there are three steps of work to do.</p>

<p>You don't need to upgrade the Kubernetes cluster in most time, there is no reason to upgrading if they running in stable, sometime we need to upgrade it for some bugs fixed and features. If you already have a running cluster and you want to upgrade it, there are three steps of work to do.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Get the upgrade plan</h2>
<p>You should get the upgrade plan with kubeadm command, run below command in one of master nodes to get the upgrade plan</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="shell">kubeadm upgrade plan
</code></pre>
<p>You should see something in stdout including like <code>You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command</code> aflter you run it, it will list all the avaliable plan for upgrade at once. For example, here is in my case</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="shell">node4 ~ # kubeadm upgrade plan
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.
[upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
[upgrade] Fetching available versions to upgrade to
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.16.2
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.16.2
[upgrade/versions] Latest stable version: v1.16.3
[upgrade/versions] Latest version in the v1.16 series: v1.16.3

External components that should be upgraded manually before you upgrade the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT   AVAILABLE
Etcd        3.3.10    3.3.15-0

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT        AVAILABLE
Kubelet     15 x v1.16.2   v1.16.3

Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.16 series:

COMPONENT            CURRENT   AVAILABLE
API Server           v1.16.2   v1.16.3
Controller Manager   v1.16.2   v1.16.3
Scheduler            v1.16.2   v1.16.3
Kube Proxy           v1.16.2   v1.16.3
CoreDNS              1.6.2     1.6.2

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

        kubeadm upgrade apply v1.16.3

Note: Before you can perform this upgrade, you have to update kubeadm to v1.16.3.
</code></pre>
<p>If there is a plan of the available list you want to continue, please, move the step 2</p>
<h2>Step 2: Download the kubeadm</h2>
<p>You will get a version from the upgrade plan, So we need to update kubeadm to the version, this work is just simplest, we can get the kubeadm from here: <img src="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/" alt="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/">.</p>
<p>We keep going to Step 3 when you are get a binary of kubeadm.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Upgrading with kubeadm</h2>
<p>Now we can run a command which from Step 1 to got it to upgrade the cluster, For example, I'll upgrade my cluster from v1.16.2 to v1.16.3 in my case.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code class="shell">node4 ~ # kubeadm upgrade apply v1.16.3
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.
[upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
[upgrade/version] You have chosen to change the cluster version to "v1.16.3"
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.16.2
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.16.3

[upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.16.3". Enjoy!

[upgrade/kubelet] Now that your control plane is upgraded, please proceed with upgrading your kubelets if you haven't already done so.
</code></pre>
<p>If you could see like <code>[upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to &quot;vX.X.X&quot;. Enjoy!</code> in the last stdout, it has been done for upgrade!</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There is a easy to make mistakes just only downloaing the kubeadm, you will see the new version by the command <code>kubectl get nodes</code> after downloaded the kubeadm, kubectl and kubelet for all the nodes. In fact, it really not a new version for working, You have to run command <code>kubeadm upgrade apply vX.X.X</code> for the last step.</p>
<p>The new versions of Kubernetes isn't stable, this is a the most important. I have heavy pay for it, I upgrade my cluster tow months ago, there are tow problems I can't do something for it for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>1„ÄÅThe pods of Complated status isn't auto remove, But it always keep last three pods of Complated status in older version. For now, I doing by the Crontab</li>
<li>2„ÄÅThe containers of Gitlab-Runner exit with code 137 even I given it enough Memory and CPU in sometime, here is my opened's issue: <img src="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/issues/114" alt="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/issues/114"></li>
